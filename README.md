# Personal-Projects
Hello! My name is Vithursan Sarvalogan and I am currently a student at UWaterloo. This is the repository of my classic blackjack project and contains files that can be downloaded and viewed. In order to run this project, simply unzip the zipped file called "Vithursan's Blackjack Game - Made with Python" which can be found under 'Code' and you will now have a folder that contains various playing card images, as well the executable python filed called "Vithursan_Blackjack_culminating.py". Do not alter this file, such as moving playing card images or the executable file outside of this folder, as the project will not execute with all the visual features. In order to run the project, you must firstly open this file, which will require you to have python 3 installed. Next, simply use the run option within your python shell, after which the game interface will be opened and the game can now be played.
