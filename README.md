# Personal-Projects
Hello! My name is Vithursan Sarvalogan and I am currently a student at UWaterloo. This is the repository of my projects and contains files that can be downloaded and viewed. Unfortunately, I only have the file to my python blackjack game available to view/download. Although I have made web development projects with  JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React, I have not yet made them available to view due to some difficulties. I will make sure to upload them ASAP, but before that happens, I am glad to provide details about these projects and how I created them by contacting me at the email 'vsarvalo@uwaterloo.ca'. Thank you for taking an interest in my work!
