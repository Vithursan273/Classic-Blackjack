# Personal-Projects
Hello! My name is Vithursan Sarvalogan and this is my repository of my personal projects. I am currently a student at UWaterloo in this repository, you can find files of my projects. Unofortunately, I only have the file to my python blackjack game available to view/download. Although I have web development projects completed with the use of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Raect, I have not yet made it available to view due to some difficulties. I will make sure to upload them ASAP, but before that happens, I am glad to provide details about these projects and how I created them by contacting me at the email 'vsarvalo@uwaterloo.ca'. Thank you for taking an interest in my work!
